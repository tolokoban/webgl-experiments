* __[Space-Adventure](https://github.com/tolokoban/space-adventure)__: Progressive app which isntalls itself on the home screen of your smartphone.
* __[Bouncing Balls](https://github.com/tolokoban/demo-bouncing-balls)__: Undreds of perfect spheres with toon shading.
* __[Platonic Solids](https://github.com/tolokoban/demo-platonic-solid)__: Illustrations in WebGL of how you can construct platonic solids.
* __[Raytracing in pure JS](https://github.com/tolokoban/demo-raytracing-no-webgl)__: Raytracing in a canvas without WebGL.
* __[Raytracing in a shader](https://github.com/tolokoban/demo-raytracing-shader)__: Same think with a __fragment shader__. Still no 3D object: just a unique plane facing the camera.
* __[Taquin 3D](https://github.com/tolokoban/taquin-3d)__: Little phone game written in HTML5 with ThreeJS.

There is also a pure WebGL [tutorial](http://tolokoban.github.io/webgl-experiments/index.html) if you can read french.
